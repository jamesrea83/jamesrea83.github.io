            <p>Working through the FCC course has always been a series of leaps and bounds. Every time you start to feel comfortable with something, you have a glance at the next set of projects and it feels like staring at an HTML file on day 1 all over again.</p>

<p>How the hell do I even start this?</p>

<p>But that’s what I love about this course. It doesn’t waste time holding your hand. Rather it points you in the direction of something that’s just beyond your current abilities, slaps you on the ass and says “go get ‘em”.</p> 

<p>Apparently, that’s the kind of learning that works for me. Trying to get my head around a new concept by diving into a text book is so torturous it should be covered by the Geneva convention. But when that same textbook has the answer to something I’m trying to sledgehammer my way through…</p>

<img src="attention.gif" class="img-responsive" />

<p>By far the biggest leap for me so far has been moving on to the backend. I’ve always been looking forward to it, and now that I’ve finished my first app I’m thoroughly enjoying it. But getting to this stage has taken a while, and I’ve deviated from the curriculum pretty drastically- I’ve decided to use PHP instead of node.</p>

<p>OK put down the pitchforks, let’s keep it civil. I’m here to talk.</p>

<p>So why the change? I completely understand why FCC went with node and the MEAN stack for their backend projects. We’ve spent all this time learning Javascript, so carrying on with it seems logical. Plus, there’s no doubt node is gaining a lot of traction. In a few years it may well be ubiquitous, and learning to work with node is most definitely on my to do list. But my decision is based on what I can observe in the real world right now.</p>

<p>One area where I’ve felt FCC is lacking is how to put all this knowledge you’re gaining to real world use. Fairly early in the course, I created this website as a place to experiment. At the back of my mind there was always a nagging feeling that while I understood what I was building, until I could actually deploy it in a meaningful way I wasn’t making real progress. This site has been a wonderful learning experience, and I highly recommend anyone else starting out to do the same.</p>

<p>Which brings us to node. I was excited to get my first local server running, start building small test programs and working through the learnyounode modules. However, when I tried to deploy a few test programs to my web server, I predictably hit a roadblock.</p>

<p>LAMP.</p>

<p>It seems so obvious now, but starting out I was diving into the backend completely blind. My generic hosting service ran their servers on Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP.</p>

<p>I mean, of course they did… but I didn’t know back then! This was all new to me.</p>

<p>This took the wind out of my sails a bit. Of course, the FCC route is to start developing on Heroku, but I still had that nagging feeling that if I couldn’t make it work in the real world, on my web server, then I was missing something.</p>

<p>Secondly, there’s the issue of job hunting. I don’t live in London or San Fran. Sunny Eastbourne isn’t a thriving tech hub- not yet anyway. Businesses aren’t looking for node and React developers yet, they want PHP. They want MySQL. They want Wordpress.</p>

<p>So that’s why I’ve decided to move to PHP for the backend, and I’m loving it so far. The first iteration of my voting app was a bloated mess that would have been a nightmare to update, and impossible to maintain- but by God it worked. After I burned that to the ground and studied the MVC model, the second iteration is a sleek, upgradable wonder by comparison.</p>

<p>I’m excited to be carrying on with the FCC projects, but the next project will be built with Laravel. And I have a feeling that’s going to be worthy of a post in its own right.</p>
